A lazer tag system, Photon, for the University of Arkansas Software Engineering spring 2025 class.

## Install
This application uses PostgreSQL. You can download PostgreSQL from [here](https://www.postgresql.org/). This application was built using version 13.

A java compiler is also needed, which can be found [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/?er=221886#java11-windows). This application was tested using Java 11.

To run application, download code as a zip file, extract the files, and run the script Game.bash using `./Game.bash`. This will open three windows: one for the game interface, a terminal for the server, and a terminal to enter in equipment IDs for the traffic generator.
Currently only compatible with Linux environments.
